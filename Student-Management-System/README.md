### Project Overview

 This project is about creating Student Management System for the XYZ university using basic python opeartions. 


### Learnings from the project

 After completion of this project, I learnt mathematical operations, List and Dictionary operations and String indexing and formatting. 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Firstly, I created two lists comprised names of students, concatenated two lists, later performing addition and deletion operation. Then I created dictionary comprised Cources and Marks (key:value pair) for a student and calculated percentage. I also performed max() to find a topper from another dictionary. Then lastly, I displayed name of topper student in uppercase with surname followed by first name using split() and upper().
